- you need to create a project to start measuring the time, so this should be in the logic:
	
	if "project_name":
		timetrace start "project_name"
	else:
		timetrace create project "project_name"
		timetrace start "project_name"

- after you start measuring time, you need to stop it:

	$ timetrace stop

	- this should be only option in webapp after starting task

- combine string to form project name that follows convention project-reference(e.g. ticket ref, or "meeting", etc)

--------------------------------------------
| PROJECT   | Reference    || |Start| |Stop|
--------------------------------------------
| "CARIAD"  | "Ticker-ref" ||
--------------------------------------------

	- from this project is named "CARIAD-Ticket-ref"

- to create a record

	$ timetrace create record <PROJECT-KEY> {<YYY-MM-DD>|today|yesterday} <HH:MM> <HH:MM>

- to delete a record

	$ timetrace delete record <YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM> --yes


- generate a report (whis will be separate page)

	- it will use repor data created with timetrace

	$ timetrace report -o json

	- this command should be run on every page load/reload
	- attention! total is in nano seconds [ns]
